# Reason Why use Node 
    I didn't get much time to explore vonage and I dont have any refference material related to vonage. You have given specific time period for this task and 
    you guys have invested time in me so I don't want to let you people down and I value your time. That's the reason I have made this application using node as backend,because I have some hands on experience on node.
